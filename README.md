## Demonstration
Clone this repository using terminal or download zip
```
git clone https://github.com/jainamshah17/attentiveness-detection.git
```
Before running the code, make sure you have installed all the required librarires
```
numpy == 1.16.1
opencv_python == 3.4.5.20
dlib == 19.16.0
```
Now execute detect.py python script from terminal
```
python detect.py
```
  
  ## Attentiveness
  1) Eye Gaze - Direction in which user is looking i.e. center / right / left ; from center of the screen
  2) Forehead Position - Position of user's forehead i.e. up / down / center ; from center of the screen
  3) Lips Distance - User is speaking / silent / yawning
    
  Based on above 3 estimations following things are done : attentiveness is scored, tells whether the user is feeling sleepy or not
